****Ideas for Site****

1. Should we have a seller rating and a buyer rating?
	Yes - Bryan, Erich, Austin (but still keep anonomyous buying, can rate a buyer who has an account but cant rate anonomyous buyers)
	No - 

2. What info should we collect from users for account?
	-Name (First, Last)
	-School Attending -> maybe check from email
	-Major
	-Collect Birthday, maybe only reveal the age to public
	-Email Address 
	-Timestamp of account creation

3. For accounts setup keep track of:
	-Ratings
	-Views
	-Number of transactions participated in

4. X number of days after transaction takes place, send email to users asking to fill out survey about how the transaction went.  
	-In survey, ask the party to rate the other party
	-Automate this process.
